# tech-interview-meetup

This is a repository of the files we use in our mock interviews.

You will need LibreOffice or Word to view and edit the files.

Why don't we store them in plain text, or MD format, or something else?
- Mainly for presentation reasons. We need it to look pretty when we print it, because that's what people are using in our mock interviews. Ping me if you can relieve us of that dependency. :)
